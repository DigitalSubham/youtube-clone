// In demo.js i got a bug

 const [text, setText] = useState(0);

 f1

 const prime = () => {
    console.log("Rerendering prime");
    return findNthPrime(text);
  };

f2

 const prime = (text) => {
    console.log("Rerendering prime");
    return findNthPrime(text);
  };

why f1 works but f2 not

In the code you provided, it seems you have two functions named prime, one without any parameters (f1) and the other with a text parameter (f2). 
The key difference between the two functions is that f1 uses the text variable from the outer scope, while f2 takes text as a parameter.

The reason why f1 works while f2 does not can be attributed to the context in which these functions are used. Let's break down the differences:

f1:
const prime = () => {
    console.log("Rerendering prime");
    return findNthPrime(text);
};
In f1, you are using the text variable without passing it as a parameter to the prime function. 
This means that prime relies on the text variable from the outer scope, which is probably defined using useState. 
If the text variable changes due to a state update (e.g., calling setText with a new value), it will trigger a re-render of the component, 
and the prime function will capture the updated value of text when executed. 
This is because functions in JavaScript have access to variables from their containing scopes (closures).


f2:

const prime = (text) => {
    console.log("Rerendering prime");
    return findNthPrime(text);
};
In f2, text is a parameter of the function. 
This means that the function prime expects you to pass a value for text when you call it, like prime(someValue). 
It doesn't rely on any external text variable from the outer scope. If you call f2 without passing a value for text, 
it will not work as expected because it doesn't automatically capture the value from the outer scope.

So, whether f1 or f2 works depends on how you intend to use them and where the text value is coming from. 
If text is supposed to come from an external source, f1 may be the more appropriate option. 
If you want to explicitly pass the text value as an argument to the function, then f2 is the way to go.
